%Revolutionizing agriculture and food industry with a software platform is possible thanks to IoT, blockchain, and e-commerce for real-time monitoring, traceability, and efficient supply chain management, from farm to market. Enhancing transparency, reducing waste, and enabling online sales, auctions, and collective buying are the features of this system.
%The goal is to implement a system able to get real-time product information access and Blockchain-based transparency. It has to ensure product safety, quality, and origin tracking, boost trust among stakeholders and prevent fraud in the agri-food supply chain.

The traceability of fruit and vegetables is a growing need, aimed at ensuring the safety and authenticity of the product for a wide range of stakeholders, from the agronomist to the final consumer. This need originates from the desire to prevent fraud and malicious practices that could compromise the quality and safety of products.

Transforming the agriculture and food industry through a software platform is achievable through the integration of IoT, blockchain, and e-commerce. This combination facilitates real-time monitoring, traceability, and efficient management of the supply chain, spanning from the farm to the market. The key features of this system include enhancing transparency, reducing waste, and enabling online sales, auctions, and collective buying.

The objective is to establish a system that provides instantaneous access to product information and incorporates Blockchain-based transparency. This system is designed to guarantee the safety, quality, and traceability of products, fostering trust among stakeholders and mitigating the risk of fraud within the agri-food supply chain.
